# Reinforcement Learning-Based Car Game for Vehicle Routing Problem

## Introduction
This Python game, built using Pygame, demonstrates a reinforcement learning approach to the vehicle routing problem (VRP). The VRP involves finding the optimal route for a vehicle to visit a set of locations while minimizing travel distance or time.

**Reinforcement Learning Algorithm**
The game employs the Q-learning algorithm, a popular method for training agents to make decisions in environments. Q-learning involves updating a Q-table, which stores the expected reward for taking a particular action in a given state.

**Epsilon-Greedy Exploration**
To ensure that the agent explores different routes and doesn't get stuck in local optima, the epsilon-greedy algorithm is used. This strategy balances exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (choosing actions that have previously yielded high rewards).
